						<p>I engaged in programming when I was 16 years old and have been passionate about the craft since then. The original stimulus came from computer games and the need to learn how to develop them myself. I began by learning c++ and windows programming. I am a person who always seeks for new things to learn and new technologies to use whenever given the chance. Over the years I have studied artificial intelligence, physics and graphics and have worked as a web developer and tools programmer. You can read more about my <a href="#employment">employment history</a> and <a href="#projects">projects</a> below. I am also an avid open source supporter and linux user and I try to give back to the community as much as possible.

								<h3>NHRF/NDC</h3>
								<p><span class="image smallthumb left"><img src="http://www.eie.gr/nhrf/images/img-ekt.gif" /></span>I am employed at the <a href="http://www.ekt.gr"><strong>National Documentation Center</strong></a> since February of 2012. My primary task is to develop from ground up the <a href="http://www.epset.gr/el/content/openabekt"><strong>new version</strong></a> of one of NDC's main products called <a href="http://abekt.ekt.gr"><strong>ABEKT</strong></a>. ABEKT is an Integrated Library System (ILS) which provides library management services to dozens of libraries around Greece. The main purpose of the ILS is to manage members holdings, circulation and provide reports and statistics.</p>
								<p>The key concept of the new implementation is to update the quality of the provided services using SaaS and the latest web technologies.</p>

								<p>My stack consists of the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com"><strong>Yii</strong></a> <strong>PHP</strong> framework, <strong>PostgreSql</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Twig</strong>, <strong>PHPUnit</strong> and <strong>git</strong>. Albeit, over the years of development and iterations, new technologies have risen and fallen and others have matured, I try to incorporate new things into the initial stack as I go and rethink the way things work or should work. That does not always go my way of course :).</p>
								<p>Technologies I touched, or used in some depth, on occusion, either for the main project or side projects, include the <strong>ruby</strong> language (not rails!), the frontend frameworks <strong>knockout</strong> and <strong>angular</strong>, <strong>mongodb</strong> and <strong>elastic search</strong>, as well as <strong>node.js</strong> and web sockets. Knockout I do use sporadically in the core project. It is very easy to integrate into existing code because of its unobstructive design approach and can provide a very nice user experience with only a few lines of code.. Angular on the other hand is a completely different story. I used it in a side project with mongo and node (the famous mean stack) in order to have a hands on experience in the stack, as well as learn what it takes to build a single page app where the server provides only services and small html templates.</p>

								<h3>MSc Dissertation: Games that learn about their users and adapt</h3>
								<p><a href="images/fulls/disser.jpg" class="image thumb left"><img src="images/fulls/disser.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								The dissertation is about describing those techniques that can be used to develop a computer player that has the ability to adapt to its opponent and its environment in realtime, by learning about them. For this purpose, there has been a lot of research done, mostly academic, in fields such as expert systems, machine learning and others.</p>
								<p>I choose to investigate the usefulness of some Machine Learning and Case Base Reasoning techniques because I felt that it consists of some very promising methods. I did that by presenting their general usability and possible applications in games and more particular in Real Time Strategy games.</p>
								<p>I choose to research the applicability of such algorithms in an <em>online</em> (realtime) <em>unsupervised</em> environment as this is a requirement of the initial research subject.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, this dissertation has as a goal to present one of the algorithms that are under the scope of this research in a practical manner. I did this by using an open-source software game engine and applying my implementation of the algorithm.</p>
								<p>The algorithm and general concept was inspired by <a href="http://ticc.uvt.nl/~pspronck/pubs/Bakkes_BNAIC06.pdf">this paper</a>. You can browse the code <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dissertation-adaptive-ai-sem3/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk">here</a>.</p>

								<h3>Resurrection</h3>
								<p><a href="http://youtu.be/KdV2ulvqNGw" data-poptrox="youtube,800x600">Watch the trailer.</a></p>
								<p>Resurrection is a 4-person project and basically a full fetched game. It is based on rough design spec written by a professional game designer. The main game consisted of a spaceship guided by the player from a top-down view that had to destroy enemy spaceships in order to collect just the right amount of energy to build an energy bomb and then fire that bomb at a crater.</p>
								<p>Collecting energy, creating bombs and firing them at craters, is puzzling because they all depend of the three different colors the game uses to represent energy forms. E.g a blue crater needs a blue bomb to be destroyed and a blue bomb needs 50% green energy and 50% yellow energy to be created. Hence, destroying the enemies with the right colors and balancing the energy space the spaceship can have, is not trivial!!</p>
								<p>We designed the game using Model-View-Controller design pattern which turned out to be extremely handy. We added several maps with different features and enemies with various characteristics, all with different difficulty levels.</p>

								<h3>Physics Simulation</h3>
								<p><a href="http://youtu.be/MSuIGHds86E" data-poptrox="youtube,800x600">Watch the trailer.</a></p>
								<p>This is a second semester project for the MSc. It is a physics simulation comprising of a deformable cloth object and rigid spheres. The user can interact with the surrounding cube by rotating it in two axis, add and remove spheres at any time and also record a try and replay it.</p>
								<p>The physics are running a basic Euler integrator, with a very small time step though. The tessellation of the cloth is high, 20Ã—30 vertices with one particle (point of mass) per vertex.</p>
								<p>The collisions taking place are between <em>planes and particles</em> as well as between <em>particles and particles</em>. That being said, I must point out that all rigid bodies are treated as a single particle, while the cloth is, as expected, treated as multi-particle object. Hence a collision with the cloth is actually a collision between all its particles and the <em>other</em> object. No optimizations so far.</p>
								<p>The system is designed as component-based, with lots of decoupling and great inter-component communication.</p>
								<p>You can browse the code <a title="Google code repo" href="http://code.google.com/p/physicssim-sem2/source/browse#svn%2Ftrunk">here</a>.</p>

								<h3>Spacegame Simulation</h3>
								<p><a href="http://youtu.be/KhtbUltT168" data-poptrox="youtube,800x600">Watch the trailer.</a></p>
								<p>This game was developed during my first semester in the games programming msc and at the time was the first large scale game I had ever made.</p>
								<p>The graphics are done in OpenGL and shaders in GLSL. The stage has per-pixel lighting, basic [CPU] particle systems and collision detection/response.</p>
								<p>It comes with two camera views, a  first and a third person camera, quaternion based rotations, in order to create smoother movement, a minimap and recording capability. Also:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>firing the laser weapon leaves scorch marks on the walls</li>
									<li>triggers doors to open</li>
									<li>stops blades from rotating</li>
									<li>disables forcefields</li>
									<li>destroys enemy laser turrets.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The game was programmed with a component-based object architecture, but the design is pretty immature.</p>

								<h3>Particle System</h3>
								<a href="images/fulls/particles.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/fulls/particles.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This was one of the very first particle systems I wrote and that's why it's here :). The physics and rendering were handled in separate threads, for no particular reason other than experimentation. The whole thing was a way to understand how to develop a multithreaded application and implement multiple particle systems.</p>

								<h3>Undergraduate Graphics Project</h3>
								<a href="images/fulls/uni.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/fulls/uni.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This was the project for a graphics module I took in my third year of my undergraduate studies. It was a very simple project that required a scene with four different objects, a moving wheel system, and a spot light. For the spotlight, instead of using a lightmap, I used a tessellated surface and I also added textures and more controls just for fun.</p>

								<h3>Start Wars</h3>
								<a href="images/fulls/startwars.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/fulls/startwars.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This very simple, silly and colorless little application was my first attempt to make a game in 2002. It used DirectDraw and had only three enemy ships that spawned from the right side of the screen in a random vertical position and moved in a straight line until they reached the end of the screen, in which time they respawned at the right side. The player could fire up to three bullets and every time he hit an enemy ship, he got one point. When an enemy ship died, it immediately respawned. The graphics were made with Windows Paint.</p>
